# SmallSlimKeyboard
A project to develop a thin ~75% mechanical keyboard with built-in battery and bluetooth support.

## Layout 

I would like to have 75% like keyboard, because mostly I don't use much of F keys. But I'm not sure that I will able to feel myself comfortable without numpad. But anyway there a lot of options of macropads and I can always go back to my laptop's numpad.
